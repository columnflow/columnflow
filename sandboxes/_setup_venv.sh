#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Script that installs and sources a virtual environment. Distinctions are made
# depending on whether the installation is already present, and whether the script is called as part
# of a remote (law) job (AP_REMOTE_JOB=1).
#
# Two environment variables are expected to be set before this script is called:
#   - AP_VENV_NAME:
#       The name of the virtual environment. It will be installed into $AP_VENV_PATH/$AP_VENV_NAME.
#   - AP_VENV_REQUIREMENTS:
#       The requirements file containing packages that are installed on top of
#       $AP_BASE/requirements_prod.txt.
#
# Upon venv activation, one environment variable is set in addition to those exported by the venv
# itself:
#   - AP_DEV: Set to "1" when AP_VENV_NAME ends with "_dev", and "0" otherwise.
#
# Arguments:
# 1. mode: The setup mode. Different values are accepted:
#   - '' (default): The virtual environment is installed when not existing yet and sourced.
#   - reinstall:    The virtual environment is removed first, then reinstalled and sourced.
#
# Note on remote jobs:
# When the AP_REMOTE_JOB variable is found to be "1" (usually set by a remote job bootstrap script),
# no mode is supported and an error is printed when it is set to a non-empty value. In any case, no
# installation will happen but the setup is reused from a pre-compiled software bundle that is
# fetched from a local or remote location and unpacked.
