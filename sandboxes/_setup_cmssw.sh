# Script that installs, removes and / or sources a CMSSW environment. Distinctions are made
# depending on whether the installation is already present, and whether the script is called as part
# of a remote (law) job (AP_REMOTE_JOB=1).
#
# Five environment variables are expected to be set before this script is called:
#   - AP_SCRAM_ARCH:
#       The scram architecture string.
#   - AP_CMSSW_VERSION:
#       The desired CMSSW version to setup.
#   - AP_CMSSW_BASE:
#       The location where the CMSSW environment should be installed.
#   - AP_CMSSW_ENV_NAME:
#       The name of the environment to prevent collisions between multiple environments using the
#       same CMSSW version.
#   - AP_CMSSW_FLAG:
#       An incremental integer value stored in the installed CMSSW environment to detect whether it
#       needs to be updated.
#
# Arguments:
# 1. mode: The setup mode. Different values are accepted:
#   - '' (default): The CMSSW environment is installed when not existing yet and sourced.
#   - clear:        The CMSSW environment is removed when existing.
#   - reinstall:    The CMSSW environment is removed first, then reinstalled and sourced.
#   - install_only: The CMSSW environment is installed when not existing yet but not sourced.
#
# Note on remote jobs:
# When the AP_REMOTE_JOB variable is found to be "1" (usually set by a remote job bootstrap script),
# no mode is supported and an error is printed when it is set to a non-empty value. In any case, no
# installation will happen but the desired CMSSW setup is reused from a pre-compiled CMSSW bundle
# that is fetched from a local or remote location and unpacked.
