    """
    Unexposed selector that does not actually select objects but that instead increments selection
    metrics in a given dictionary *stats* given a chunk of *events* and the corresponding selection
    *results*.

    A weight_map* can be defined to configure the actual fields to be added. The key of each entry
    should either start with ``"num``, to state that it will refer to a plain number of events, or
    ``"sum"``, to state that the field describes the sum of a specific column (usualky weights).
    Different types of values are accepted, depending on the type of "operation":

        - ``"num"``: An event mask, or an *Ellipsis* to select all events.
        - ``"sum"``: Either a column to sum over, or a 2-tuple containing the column to sum, and
                     an event mask to only sum over certain events.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        # weight map definition
        weight_map = {
            # "num" operations
            "num_events": Ellipsis,  # all events
            "num_events_selected": results.main.event,  # selected events only
            # "sum" operations
            "sum_mc_weight": events.mc_weight,  # weights of all events
            "sum_mc_weight_selected": (events.mc_weight, results.main.event),  # weights of selected events
        }

        # usage within an exposed selector
        # (where results are generated, and events and stats were passed by SelectEvents)
        self[increment_stats_per_process](events, results, stats, weight_map=weight_map, **kwargs)

    Each sum of weights can also be extracted for each unique element in a so-called group, such as
    per process id, or per jet multiplicity bin. For this purpose, a *group_map* can be defined,
    mapping the name of a group (e.g. ``"process"`` or ``"njet"``) to a dictionary with the fields

        - ``"values"``, unique values to loop over,
        - ``"mask_fn"``, a function that is supposed to return a mask given a single value, and
        - ``"combinations_only"`` (optional), a boolean flag (*False* by default) that decides
            whether this group is not to be evaluated on its own, but only as part of a combination
            with other groups (see below).

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        group_map = {
            "process": {
                "values": events.process_id,
                "mask_fn": (lambda v: events.process_id == v),
            },
            "njet": {
                "values": results.x.n_jets,
                "mask_fn": (lambda v: results.x.n_jets == v),
            },
        }

    Based on the *weight_map* in the example above, this will result in eight additional fields in
    *stats*, e.g, ``"sum_mc_weight_per_process"``, ``"sum_mc_weight_selected_per_process"``,
    ``"sum_mc_weight_per_njet"``, ``"sum_mc_weight_selected_per_njet"``, etc. (same of "num"). Each
    of these new fields will refer to a dictionary with keys corresponding to the unique values
    defined in the *group_map* above.

    In addition, combinations of groups can be configured using *group_combinations*. It accepts a
    sequence of tuples whose elements should be names of groups in *group_names*. As the name
    suggests, combinations of all possible values between groups are evaluated and stored in a
    nested dictionary.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        group_combinations = [("process", "njet")]

    In this case, *stats* will obtain additional fields, such as
    ``"sum_mc_weight_per_process_and_njet"`` and ``"sum_mc_weight_selected_per_process_and_njet"``,
    referring to nested dictionaries whose structure depends on the exact order of group names per
    tuple.
