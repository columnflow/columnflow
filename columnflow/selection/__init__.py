class Selector(TaskArrayFunction):
    """Derivative of :py:class:`~columnflow.columnar_util.TaskArrayFunction`
    that handles selections.

    :py:class:`~.Selector` s are designed to apply
    arbitrary selection criteria. These critera can be based on already existing
    nano AOD columns, but can also involve the output of any other module,
    e.g. :py:class:`~columnflow.production.Producer`s. To reduce the need to
    run potentionally computation-expensive operations multiple times, they can
    also write new columns. Similar to :py:class:`~columnflow.production.Producer` s,
    and :py:class:`~columnflow.calibration.Calibrator` s, this new columns must
    be specified in the `produces` set.

    Apart from the awkward array, a :py:class:`~.Selector` must also return a
    :py:class:`~.SelectionResult`. This object contains boolean masks on event
    and object level that represent which objects and events pass different
    selections. These masks are saved to disc and are intended for more involved
    studies, e.g. comparisons between frameworks.

    To create a new :py:class:`~.Selector`, you can use the decorrator
    class method :py:meth:`~.Selector.selector` like this:


    .. code-block:: python

        # import the Selector class and the selector method
        from columnflow.selection import Selector, selector

        # also import the SelectionResult
        from columnflow.selection import SelectionResult

        # maybe import awkard in case this Selector is actually run
        ak = maybe_import("awkward")

        # now wrap any function with a selector
        @selector(
            # define some additional information here, e.g.
            # what columns are needed for this Selector?
            uses={
                "Jet.pt", "Jet.eta"
            },
            # does this Selector produce any columns?
            produces={}

            # pass any other variable to the selector class
            is_this_a_fun_auxiliary_variable=True

            # ...
        )
        def jet_selection(events: ak.Array) -> ak.Array, SelectionResult:
            # do something ...

    The decorrator will create a new :py:class:`~.Selector` instance with the
    name of your function. The function itself is set as the `call_func` if
    the :py:class:`~.Selector` instance. All keyword arguments specified in the
    :py:meth:`~.Selector.selector` are available as member variables of your
    new :py:class:`~.Selector` instance.

    In additional to the member variables inherited from
    :py:class:`~columnflow.columnar_util.TaskArrayFunction` class, the
    :py:class:`~.Selector` class defines the *exposed* variable. This member
    variable controls whether this :py:class:`~.Selector` instance is a
    top level Selector that can be used directly for the
    :py:class:`~columnflow.tasks.selection.SelectEvents` task.
    A top level :py:class:`~.Selector` should not need anything apart from
    the awkward array containing the events, e.g.

    .. code-block:: python

        @selector(
            # some information for Selector

            # This Selector will need some external input, see below
            # Therefore, it should not be exposed
            exposed=False
        )

            events: ak.Array,
            some_additional_input: Any
        ) -> ak.Array, SelectionResult:
            result = SelectionResult()
            # do stuff with additional information
            return events, result

            # some information for Selector
            # e.g., if we want to use some internal Selector, make
            # sure that you have all the relevant information
            uses={
                some_internal_selector,
            },
            produces={
                some_internal_selector,
            }

            # this is our top level Selector, so we need to make it reachable
            # for the SelectEvents task

            additional_info = 2
            events, sub_result = self[some_internal_selector](events, additional_info)
            result += sub_result

class SelectionResult(od.AuxDataMixin):
    """Lightweight class that wraps selection decisions (e.g. event and object
    selection steps).

    Additionally, this class provides convenience methods to merge them or to dump
    them into an awkward array. Arbitrary, auxiliary information
    (additional arrays, or other objects) that should not be stored in dumped
    akward arrays can be placed in the *aux* dictionary
    (see :py:class:`~order.mixins.AuxDataMixin`).

    The resulting structure looks like the following example:

    .. code-block:: python

        results = {
            # arbitrary, top-level main fields
            ...

            "steps": {

                "jet": array_of_event_masks,
                "muon": array_of_event_masks,
                ...,
            },

            "objects": {
                # object selection decisions or indices
                # define type of this field here, define that `jet` is of
                # type `Jet`
                "Jet": {
                    "jet": array_of_jet_indices,
                },
                "Muon": {
                    "muon": array_of_muon_indices,
                },
                ...,
            },
            # additionally, you can also save auxiliary data, e.g.
            "aux": {
                # save the per-object jet selection masks
                "jet": array_of_jet_object_masks,
                # save number of jets
                "n_passed_jets": ak.num(array_of_jet_indices, axis=1),
                ...,
            },
            ...
        }

    The fields can be configured through the *main*, *steps* and *objects*
    keyword arguments. The following example creates the structure above.
